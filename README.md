# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
Steps:
1. Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
2. Evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
3. Optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. 
4. Explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

This project is designed to test some supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn.
It also provides for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. 

Things I tried by completing this project:

How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
